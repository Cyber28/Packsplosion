# **PACKSPLOSION!!!**

**OPEN YOUR PACKS WITH JUST 1 CLICK! PACKSPLOSION!!!!!!**

## Installation (manual)

You need the [pre-configured BepInEx pack](https://stacklands.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_Stacklands) for this mod. If you installed BepInEx from a different place, you will need to edit the config files.

Extract the contents of this folder to `Stacklands/BepInEx/plugins/Packsplosion`. The final folder layout should look like this:
```
plugins/
  Packsplosion/
    Packsplosion.dll
    icon.png
    manifest.json
    README.md
```
